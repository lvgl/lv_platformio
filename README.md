# Run LittlevGL via PlatformIO

[![CI](https://github.com/lvgl/lv_platformio/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/lvgl/lv_platformio/actions)

This demo should help you to organize your project with awesome PlatformIO IDE.

1. It automates installing everything - just open folder with this project in
   [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and agree to install all it offers.
2. It contains working LVGL demo, runnable on both bare metal and PC.
3. It has example, how to configure PlatomIO.


## How to install & use demo

### Install Visual Studio Code

https://code.visualstudio.com/ - follow instructions there, if you don't have
vscode yet.


### Install SDL drivers

**Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, ...)**

Use one of options below:

```sh
# 64 bits
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
```

```sh
# 32 bits
sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib g++-multilib libsdl2-dev:i386
```

Note:

- Use 32-bits build for more correct memory stat info.
- If you have conflicts on `libsdl2-dev:i386` install, remove 64-bits version
  and dependencies first.

**MacOS**

Use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```sh
brew install sdl2
```
Note: 
On MacOS you need to include (uncomment in provided example platformio.ini file) these lines in your platformio.ini file to import the drivers:
```
  ; SDL2 includes
  !find /opt/homebrew/Cellar/sdl2 -name "include" | sed "s/^/-I /"
  !find /opt/homebrew/Cellar/sdl2 -name "libSDL2.a" | xargs dirname | sed "s/^/-L /"
```

If you get the following error on M-chip Mac with VSCode, you can add `-arch arm64` to `build_flags` in `platformio.ini` or just run `pio run -e emulator_64bits -t execute` in the system Python environment. (`pio` should be installed in system Python first).
```
ld: warning: ignoring file '/opt/homebrew/Cellar/sdl2/2.30.1/lib/libSDL2-2.0.0.dylib': found architecture 'arm64', required architecture 'x86_64'
ld: Undefined symbols:
  _SDL_CreateRenderer, referenced from:
      _window_create in sdl.o
...
```


**Windows**

Use [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)

```sh
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2
```

Add the path to your Mingw-w64 `bin` folder to the Windows PATH environment
variable (usually `C:\msys64\mingw64\bin`). See [instruction, 4](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw#_prerequisites).


### Install flasher drivers (optional)

If you plan to upload firmware & debug hardware, read notes in PlatformIO
[install docs](http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/installation.html#troubleshooting).


### Build/Run

1. Clone this repository or download as zip.
2. In vscode, open folder via `File` -> `Open Folder...` menu.
   - If you do it first time - agree, when it suggests to install PlatformIO
     plugin, and wait when PlatformIO then install build tools and package
     dependencies.

To build/execute, on PlafomIO tab expand desired env and click target:

Note, for emulator env `upload` also executes compiled binary.
